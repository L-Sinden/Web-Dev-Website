      <h2>Here are some fun facts about arcade machines</h2>
      <p><b>1. Space Invaders caused a coin shortage in Japan</b><br>When Space Invaders was released in 1978 it became so popular that players were pumping coins into the machines non-stop. In Japan, the demand for 100 yen coins skyrocketed, leading to a temporary shortage. The Japanese government even had to increase coin production to keep up with the craze.</p>

      <p><b>2. Pinball machines were once banned in major U.S. cities</b><br>In the 1940s and 50s, pinball was considered a form of gambling, and cities like New York and Los Angeles outlawed it. Police raids would confiscate machines, sometimes smashing them in public. These bans lasted for decades — New York City didn’t lift its pinball ban until 1976.</p>

      <p><b>3. Some arcade cabinets have Easter eggs hidden inside</b><br>Developers sometimes left secret messages, credits, or mini-games inside arcade machines, known as Easter eggs. For example, in Adventure (1980), players could find the name of the game’s creator hidden in a secret room — one of the first known Easter eggs in gaming history.</p>

      <p><b>4. Pong, the first hit arcade video game, broke because it made too much money</b><br>In 1972, Atari tested Pong in a local bar. Within days the machine stopped working — not because of a technical failure, but because the coin box had been jammed by so many quarters that it couldn’t accept any more money. This surprising success convinced Atari that arcade video games could become a massive business.</p>

      <p><b>5. Pac-Man’s name had to be changed for the U.S. market</b><br>When Namco first released the game in Japan in 1980, it was called Puck Man because Pac-Man’s mouth looked like a puck. However, when the game was set to launch in the U.S., the name was changed to Pac-Man to prevent vandals from scratching the “P” into an “F” on arcade cabinets.</p>
